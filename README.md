# Workload Scheduling On Computer Clusters Using Deep Reinforcement Learning
## Deep Learning EC523/CS523


Both `schedule_bot.ipynb` and `experiment/Experiment.ipynb` require no special installation run code. The python notebooks in this repo will run on Google Colab.


#### schedule_bot.ipynb 
This notebook contains the final version of the scheduler. It simulates data to run the scheduler against Shortest Job First


#### experiment/Experiment.ipynb
This notebook consists of experiements to test the scheduler. It runs simulated data to graph loss.
